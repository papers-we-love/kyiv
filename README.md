# Kyiv

This is the repository for the Kyiv chapter of Papers We Love. As a local chapter we follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/kyiv/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

### Information

We are a community built around reading, discussing and learning more about academic computer science papers. This part of CS-related topics are not covered well in Ukraine. PWL Kyiv is an attempt to solve this.
